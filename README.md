## Deep South (Park)
South Park conversation generator, ideally based on deep learning.

Compared to Microsoft's Tay (@tayandyou) this is much safer and family friendlier. Although this was designed to be horrible, while Tay was designed to be chill. I think I've failed here :)

DEMO: http://enricoros.github.io/deep-south

Endless conversation generator for South Park; see your faves bashing each other, for when SP is not on tv!
Also, this is a testbed for simple conversation or deep learning algorithms.

### Techs
Uses mdl, d3, jquery and aggregates a bunch of open data.
